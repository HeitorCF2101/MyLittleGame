# MyLittleGame
This project is a turn based combat system made with C++ and it's standard libraries that I did to apply concepts that I studied by myself.
The game consists of two players attacking eachother by turns, they have an initial choice to attack or quit, if they choose to fight, they will take turns in choosing attacks preconfigured in the code, the game ends if one of the players is defeated or if they choose to quit.
